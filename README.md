# Porfolio Project Checklist

## Data Science

[X] Set up Github repo
[X] Code locally (Jupyter, VSCode, PyCharm, notebook + terminal, etc.)

[X] Have a README
[ ] Include business logic or intent
[ ] Explain it works at a high level
[ ] Summarize the process and comments throughout after doing the modeling

[ ] Outline with CRISP-DM framework

[ ] Import data
[ ] Do exploratory data analysis
[ ] Deplicates, nulls, counts, averages, spread
[ ] Decide how to handle nulls (different columns may need handled differently)
[ ] Perform freature engineering
[ ] Try models
[ ] Explain what models you considered and what you chose and why
[ ] Explain what features you used and why
[ ] Create new features if needed
[ ] Evaluate models
[ ] Explain what evaluation metrics you considered and what you chose and why

Bonus
[ ] Make unit tests for functions
[ ] Talk about how it could be deployed (API, batch, stream, etc)
[ ] Make a Streamlit app for it
